[Kubernetes] (short K8S) has in the last years become the defacto standard for container orchestration outrivaling alternatives like Docker Swarm or Apache Mesos. (Though [Nomad] from Hashicorp seems promising).

K8S has spawned a ecosystem of tools building on it like [Helm] or advanced concepts like [Operator Framework].
